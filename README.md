# Time Boy vs. Thyme Boy

#### By Will Johnson

## Description

The basic structure for a simplistic RPG about time travel in a very short period of time before a lose state. There isn't much going on at the moment and I don't work on it very often due to involvement in other projects, but I wouldn't call it scrapped. At the moment all you can do is go back in time, and your time travel watch will heat up with use with a overheat state.
